# KaTeXFlowy
Supports formula rendering in WorkFlowy with KaTeX.

## How to use
This is a userscript for Tampermonkey. If you haven't used Tampermonkey before, first [install it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). Then create a new script through Tampermonkey and paste the content of KaTeXFlowy.js into it. Now open or refresh your WorkFlowy page and you can see the effect.

Put your formula inside `$$...$$`. For example: `$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$`

Because WorkFlowy does not support line breaks in bullets, you can use multiline formula in the note section.

At present, only one formula is rendered in each bullet or note. I can change this if there are real users of this script.
